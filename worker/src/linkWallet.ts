/**
 * Per-link wallet keys.
 *
 * WHAT REPLACED WHAT
 * There used to be one funded relayer key, held in configuration, signing for
 * every merchant. The review rejected it — single point of failure, no spending
 * limits, one nonce sequence that blocks under load — and rejected a pool of
 * such keys for the same reason: a funded key still sits on the payment path.
 *
 * Here there is no funded key at all. Each link gets its own account-abstraction
 * wallet whose gas a paymaster pays, so the wallet holds nothing and can hold
 * nothing. What we store is that wallet's signing key, and its entire authority
 * is calling `LinkRouter` for one link. Stealing it yields the key to an empty
 * box.
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT SECRET
 * Two independent things are needed to recover a link key: the master secret
 * AND read access to the key store. They are deliberately kept apart, which is
 * also why keys are never derived deterministically from the link id alone —
 * that would make the master secret sufficient on its own, and there would be
 * no store left to compromise separately.
 *
 * In production `LINK_KEY_MASTER` should be a handle to a managed key service
 * rather than raw material in configuration, so that every unwrap is logged and
 * the credential can be revoked in seconds. The interface below does not change
 * when that swap happens: only `importMaster` does.

 * WHY THERE IS NO CAP ANY MORE
 * There used to be a 30-day ceiling, on the reasoning that an indefinitely
 * valid signing key is what this design exists to remove. Round-3 review, M1,
 * showed that reasoning was wrong here and the cap was actively harmful:
 *
 *   • `createLink` permits `expiresAt = 0`, a link that never expires
 *   • the cap evicted its key at day 30
 *   • `registerAgent` is WRITE-ONCE, so a fresh key — which derives a different
 *     account address — can never be bound
 *
 * The link then reads ACTIVE on-chain and fails for every customer, forever,
 * with no way back. A comment here claimed the link "is re-issued while it
 * stays live"; no such path existed, and the write-once binding is precisely
 * what prevents one.
 *
 * The cap bought nothing to offset that. This key's entire power is placing an
 * order on ONE link, at a price the merchant fixed, and mark-paid and cancel
 * need the customer's signature on top. An indefinitely valid key to that is
 * exactly as dangerous as an indefinitely payable link — which is what the
 * merchant chose when they set no expiry. Capping the key BELOW the link's life
 * created a failure; it prevented nothing.
 *
 * So: no expiry on the link, no expiry on the key. Revoking the link deletes it
 * (`destroyLinkWallet`), which is the real off-switch.
