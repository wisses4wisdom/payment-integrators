/**
 * Sending a payment as a user operation.
 *
 * This is what replaces `wallet.writeContract` plus the nonce manager. The old
 * path signed a transaction from a funded key and had to track that key's nonce
 * globally, which is why one stuck payment blocked every later one. Here the
 * sender is the link's own account: it has its own nonce sequence, so nothing
 * queues behind anyone else's traffic, and it holds no balance because a
 * paymaster pays.
 *
 * THE TRAP THIS FILE EXISTS TO AVOID
 * `handleOps` does NOT revert when the inner call fails. The EntryPoint catches
 * it and reports the outcome in `UserOperationEvent.success`, so a rejected
 * operation and a successful one look identical from the outside — the bundler
 * returns a hash either way and the transaction succeeds.
 *
 * That is the same shape as the bug that made link orders unpayable: the
 * Diamond swallowed a failed callback, so a lost daily slot looked like a
 * normal completion. `waitForUserOp` below therefore treats a missing or false
 * success flag as a FAILURE, never as "probably fine". Anything else would let
 * a refused payment be reported to a customer as accepted.
