/**
 * Who is allowed to touch the blocklist.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A SHARED SECRET
 * A secret in configuration is one string that everyone with deploy access
 * holds, that nobody can be individually revoked from, and that leaves no trace
 * of WHO acted. For an endpoint whose whole purpose is reviewing a decision and
 * overriding it, "someone with the secret did this" is not good enough.
 *
 * The integrator already answers this question. It has a super-admin — the
 * single unremovable root — who assigns admins by tier, and `roleOf` reports the
 * effective tier of any address, with owners reading as FINANCE. So the operator
 * signs with the same wallet that already governs the contract, and authority
 * here follows authority there: add an admin on-chain and they can review blocks;
 * remove them and they cannot. Nothing to distribute, nothing to rotate, and the
 * signature says which person acted.
 *
 * THE TIER
 * SUPPORT, matching where the contract puts freezing a merchant — the same
 * shape of action: reversible, operational, no funds. The super-admin and every
 * owner clear it automatically by reading as FINANCE.
 *
 * WHAT THE SIGNATURE COVERS
 * The action, the address it concerns, and an expiry. A signature that named
 * only the signer would be a bearer token: capture one unblock request and you
 * could replay it for any address, forever. Binding the action and adding a
 * short window makes a captured signature useful only for the thing it already
 * did, and only briefly.
