/**
 * POST /api/links/:linkId/wallet — mint the wallet a link is driven by.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Round-3 review, B1: nothing in production ever called `createLinkWallet`. The
 * key that `linkOps` unwraps to sign every payment was written only by tests, so
 * on a real deployment `linkSigner` returned null and every payment answered
 * "This payment link is no longer active." Separately, the merchant had no way
 * to obtain the account address `registerAgent` requires — it is generated
 * inside `createLinkWallet` and returned only to its caller.
 *
 * This is that caller.
 *
 * THE ORDERING THE MERCHANT APP MUST FOLLOW
 *   1. POST here with the linkId  →  returns the account address
 *   2. batch, IN THIS ORDER:
 *        integrator.createLink(linkId, …)
 *        router.registerAgent(linkId, account)
 *
 * `registerAgent` reads `getLink` to check ownership, so `createLink` has to
 * land first WITHIN the batch. Reversed, the batch reverts on a link that does
 * not exist yet — which at least fails loudly, unlike omitting step 2 entirely.
 *
 * WHY THE ADDRESS IS MINTED BEFORE THE LINK EXISTS
 * Because the batch needs it before it is signed. That means ownership cannot
 * be checked against `link.owner` — the link is not there yet. So:
 *
 *   • the signer must ALWAYS be a registered, non-frozen merchant
 *   • AND, if the link already exists, its owner
 *
 * Both, not either. See `authorise` for why the order of those two reads
 * matters more than it looks.

/**
 * Verifies the merchant signed THIS request, for THIS link.
 *
 * The linkId is inside the signature. Without it a captured signature would
 * mint a wallet for any link the holder named — and since the address is what
 * gets bound on-chain, that is the whole authorisation.
 *
 * `signer` IS THE MERCHANT ACCOUNT, NOT THE KEY THAT SIGNED
 * In production the merchant is a smart account: a social login controls an
 * owner key, but the address registered as a merchant, and recorded as
 * `link.owner`, is the ACCOUNT. Recovering the signature to an EOA and looking
 * that up finds no merchant, so every real merchant is refused — which is
 * exactly what happened, and only surfaced once a test used a smart account
 * instead of an EOA.
 *
 * So verification goes through the PUBLIC CLIENT rather than the standalone
 * helper. For a contract it asks the account itself, via ERC-1271; for an EOA
 * it does ordinary recovery. Both shapes work, and the address checked is the
 * one the contract will actually compare against.

/**
 * Is this signer allowed to mint a wallet for this link?
 *
 * Two checks, in this order, and the order is the point:
 *
 *   1. The signer must be a REGISTERED, NON-FROZEN merchant. Always. A frozen
 *      merchant cannot take payments, so minting them a wallet only creates
 *      something that fails later, after a customer has engaged with it.
 *
 *   2. If the link ALREADY exists, the signer must be its owner.
 *
 * Doing the merchant read FIRST also settles a question the naive version got
 * wrong. `getLink` reverts `LinkNotFound` for a link that does not exist yet —
 * the normal case here, since the address is needed before the batch — but it
 * also throws when the RPC is simply unreachable. An earlier version caught
 * both and fell through to the weaker check, so an RPC blip on someone else's
 * existing link let a different merchant mint for it. They could not then
 * `registerAgent` (the Router checks the owner), but they occupied the record,
 * and the real owner's link id was dead.
 *
 * A successful merchant read proves the RPC is answering. Only then is a
 * `getLink` failure attributable to the link not existing.
 *
 * Returns the link's expiry when allowed, since that sizes the key's lifetime.
