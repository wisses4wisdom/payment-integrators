/**
 * PayQR payment-links relayer.
 *
 * Places orders on a merchant's behalf when a walletless customer pays a link.
 * The wallet it holds can call exactly one function on our integrator —
 * `relayerPlaceOrder` — and is never a registered merchant, so it has no path
 * to anyone's funds. See the contract's own guards for the real boundary; this
 * service is convenience and cost control.
