/**
 * Driving a link's payment through the Router.
 *
 * This is the seam where the funded relayer key stops being used. Both payment
 * endpoints call in here instead of signing a transaction from a shared EOA:
 *
 *   old:  relayer EOA  --writeContract-->  integrator
 *   new:  link account --userOperation-->  Router --> integrator
 *
 * Three things change as a consequence, and each removes a whole class of
 * failure rather than mitigating it:
 *
 *   • Nothing here holds a balance, so nothing can run out of gas. The
 *     sponsorship policy is the only spending control, and it is enforced
 *     before the operation reaches the chain rather than after money is spent.
 *
 *   • Each link's account has its own nonce sequence, so one stuck payment
 *     cannot block every later one. The global nonce manager, and the
 *     head-of-line blocking it caused, are simply not needed.
 *
 *   • A stolen key is scoped to one link and cannot settle anything on its own,
 *     because mark-paid and cancel carry the customer's signature.
 *
 * THE MISTAKE THIS FILE MUST NOT MAKE
 * `handleOps` does not revert when the inner call fails — the EntryPoint
 * catches it and records the outcome in `UserOperationEvent.success`. So a
 * bundler hash is NOT proof a payment happened. Every path below waits for that
 * flag and treats anything other than an explicit `true` as failure. Reporting
 * on the hash alone would tell a customer their payment went through when the
 * Router rejected it.
