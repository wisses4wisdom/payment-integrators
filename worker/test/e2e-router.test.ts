/**
 * The relayer-free payment path, end to end, through the WORKER's real code.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM test/LinkRouter*.ts
 * The contract suites prove the Router's rules and prove that a sponsored
 * operation works. What they do not touch is the part the worker actually owns
 * now: packing a user operation the way the EntryPoint hashes it, folding
 * factory and paymaster fields into `initCode` and `paymasterAndData`, deciding
 * whether an account needs deploying, and reading the outcome back. Every one
 * of those is silent when wrong.
 *
 * So nothing in `src/` is stubbed here. `linkOps` → `aa` → JSON-RPC runs
 * exactly as it will in production; only `BUNDLER_URL` and `PAYMASTER_URL`
 * point at a local stand-in instead of a hosted one. If the packing is wrong,
 * these tests fail the same way production would.
 *
 * Requires `npx hardhat node` and `scripts/e2e-setup.js`.
