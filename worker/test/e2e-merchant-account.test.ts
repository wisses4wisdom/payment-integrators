/**
 * The merchant as a SMART ACCOUNT, which is what production actually has.
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS
 * Every other fixture in this repo creates links by signing straight from a
 * plain EOA, because that is the shortest way to get a link on-chain. In
 * production the merchant signs in with a social login and gets a smart
 * account, so every merchant action is a user operation — a different code path
 * with different failure modes, none of which the EOA fixtures touch.
 *
 * That gap is not hypothetical. The account-factory ABI shipped wrong for
 * exactly this reason: the local fixture was the reference factory, so the
 * wrong shape passed every test and would have failed on the first real
 * payment. Fixtures agreeing with themselves is the failure mode; this suite
 * exists to stop the merchant side doing the same.
 *
 * THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST
 * Production batches `createLink` and `registerAgent` into a SINGLE operation,
 * so the merchant taps once. If batching does not work, a link is created
 * without its agent — and a link without an agent looks completely correct in
 * the merchant's list, in the contract, and to the customer opening it, right
 * up until payment, which can never happen. That case is asserted below.
 *
 * Requires `npx hardhat node` and `scripts/e2e-setup.js`.
