/**
 * The user-operation client.
 *
 * WHAT IS WORTH TESTING HERE
 * Not the bundler — that is someone else's service, and the contract suite
 * already drives the whole flow through a real EntryPoint. What is worth
 * pinning is the two things this file gets to decide, both of which fail
 * quietly when wrong:
 *
 *   1. The call really is wrapped as the account's own `execute`, with ZERO
 *      value. The account holds nothing, so a non-zero value would revert at
 *      the worst possible moment — after the customer has sent their fiat.
 *
 *   2. `success` is read from UserOperationEvent, and a MISSING flag counts as
 *      failure. `handleOps` does not revert when the inner call fails: the
 *      EntryPoint catches it and records the outcome in that event, so a
 *      refused payment and a completed one are indistinguishable from the
 *      outside. This is the same shape as the Diamond swallowing a failed
 *      callback, which is how link orders came to be silently unpayable.
